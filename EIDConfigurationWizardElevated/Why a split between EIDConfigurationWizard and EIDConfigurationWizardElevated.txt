because of a nasty UAC bug.

On a task list url, if the application is non elevated and you choose 
to launch an elevated process, this process goes to the back.
Whatever ShowWindow MoveWindow you call, the window stay behind,
hidden by the control panel.

Only an application elevated because of its manifest can has a position "on top".
So the only difference between the application, is the manifest :
"requires administrator".
